# BlueProto

> All our Protobuf definitions &amp; autogenerated code in one place.

![badge](https://github.com/blue-health/blue-proto/workflows/Develop/badge.svg)
  
## Purpose

This repo houses Protobuf contracts we use at Blue to define our internal services and events. Upon any modifications to the schema, the CI automatically rebuilds the client/server stubs as well as event structs for our target langauges, Golang and Typescript. This repo, versioned via Github releases, can then be imported by each ecosystem's package manager.

## Structure

- `.github/workflows/`: GitHub Actions CI workflows
- `definitions`: Proto definitions
  - `events`: Proto schemas for events enabling asynchronous communication
  - `services`: Proto schemas for GRPC services defining contracts between our microservices
- `generated`: Auto-generated cliend code
  - `events`: Language-specific defintions of the events
  - `services`: Language-specific defintions of the GRPC clients/servers/requests/responses
